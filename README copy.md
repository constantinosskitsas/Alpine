# Alpine: Partial Unlabeled Graph Alignment
Abstract
The necessity to align two graphs, minimizing a structural distance
metric, is prevalent in biology, chemistry, recommender systems,
and social network analysis. Due to the problemâ€™s NP-hardness,
prevailing graph alignment methods follow an attributed and la-
beled approach, for equally-size graphs, solving a linear assignment
problem over intermediary graph representations. However, in re-
ality we often phase unrestricted scenarios, where we seek to align
